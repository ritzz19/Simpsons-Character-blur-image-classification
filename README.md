# Simpsons Character identification:
In this project I have taken ten simpsons charcaters and have tried to make end to end image classification.

## Data generator:

1.I have taken complete dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset) but have used just 1038 images in total for 10 different characters due to computational restriction.

2. Here I have blurred 30% of data in each category.

4. I have made skewed dataset where I have used one category which is just 3% of total dataset.

5. I have done data generator porcess in Data Genrator file.


## Training:
